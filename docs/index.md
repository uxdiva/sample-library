# sample-library

## Goals
- Explore hosting our Pattern Library on Github
- Exporting current library items from Notion into Github
- Ability to have InVision / Code links
- Ability to have MD templates for consistency of page types
- Displaying the Library through GitHub Pages
- Hosting the full CSS for pulling into development environments
- Prototyping

## Examples
We'll want to be able to have embeds from both CodePen and InVision to show examples
These pages explore looking at how that can be done.
